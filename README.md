## 📘 Project Description

The **Titanic Survival Prediction** project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow — including **data preprocessing**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **feature engineering**, and **model evaluation**.

Through this notebook, we build and optimize classification models to predict passenger survival outcomes, showcasing essential data science practices for structured datasets.

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic)  

### 🔍 Key Highlights
- Performed **data cleaning** and handled missing values efficiently.  
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and correlations.  
- Applied **feature encoding**, **scaling**, and **transformation** techniques.  
- Implemented and compared multiple classification models:
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Tuned hyperparameters using **Grid Search** and validated results using **cross-validation**.  
- Evaluated models based on **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
